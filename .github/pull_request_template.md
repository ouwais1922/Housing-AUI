<!-- Let's deal with 4 types of PRs:
  - Heads up: don't wait too long for review, just make a PR and merge it a little while later
  - WIP: you don't want feedback right now, you're just making a "private" PR of sorts
  - Early feedback: technically also work in progress, but you want some initial feedback about the general approach/logic
  - Full review: full-fledged feature you want as much review on as possible
